# Caption App

Caption is a menu bar app which can be used to categorize useful items from your clipboard. I created it to help developers like me keep track of useful terminal commands that may only be useful once a month but are hard to keep track of. I look forward to seeing what other needs steer the future of this app as time goes on.

## Features
- Persistent clipboard watching to easily gather commands 
- Ability to tag entries for organization
- Searchable text enxtries and tags
- Cleanup of old, untagged entries


## Future Additions
1. Add the ability to manually import entries, instead of just relying on clipboard
2. Settings menu for more in-depth configuration
    - Custom cleanup configuration
3. Previews within XCode
4. The ability to import/export data
5. Searchable context/description field for entries in addtion to tags
